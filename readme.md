# What is the idea behind *fox*?

*fox* is a very thin coat over assembly. In other words: Programming in *fox* feels like writing assembly, but with added convenience features. This is what's planned:

* [ ] Variables with identifiers
* [ ] Human-readable loops
* [ ] Easy function calling with arguments


# What does *fox* code look like?

```
# this is a comment
var x    # define variable
x 7      # assign value 7
return x # return variable
```
